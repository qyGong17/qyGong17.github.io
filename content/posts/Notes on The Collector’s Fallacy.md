Notes on: [The Collector’s Fallacy • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/)

# Collector's Fallacy
Hoarding information, such as making copies and bookmarking webpages, can be addictive, because we have instant feedback: we did something, and the collection volumn increases. 

However, apart from the plies of collection, actually we haven't learned a thing. 

# What to do instead
We need to assimilate the information and increase our own knowledge, and one of the first steps is to take notes. 

When we need the information, instead of going through the reference again, we can refer to our notes. 

> I rarely consult secondary sources again. If I have to do so, it means that I did not do the job right the first time.  –[MK, of “Taking Note Now”](http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2013/11/devonthink-reconsidered.html) (This blog link is broken, but anyways, a good point)


Use shorter `research-process-assimilate` cycle, for example:
1. Set 1 hour limit to search for new materials. 
2. Process all the materials, make necessary notes. 
3. Review the cycle and make changes, such as increasing or reducing the research duration. 

In this way, the collected information is readily processed, and with each cycle, our knowledge base grows, making future research more efficient (I guess).
